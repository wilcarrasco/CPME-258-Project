## Project Tile: 
Deep Learning CNN dog/cat Classifier w/VGG16
 
## Description:
Using a Convolutional Neural Network w/ VGG16 to identify cat & dog images.

## Project Idea
Using multiple images of cats and dogs can we create a CNN to categorize images between the two types.

## Proposed Solution
Step 1: Data ingestion, data cleaning, and initial visualization (if necessary)

Step 2: Preprocessing as needed - as we decide on an appropriate approach, this step may or may not be required

Step 3: Split dataset into training and testing datasets (80% training, 20% testing)

Step 4: Train the CNN model using the 80% of the dataset allocated to training

Step 5: Evaluate the model against the test set and verify accuracy metrics

Step 6: Revisit steps as required to incorporate learned techniques to improve metrics

Step 7: Feed the model new and unseen data and verify correct classification
